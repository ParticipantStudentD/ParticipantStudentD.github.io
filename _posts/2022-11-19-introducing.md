Greetings to you, traveller!

Today, I shall present to you the addidiotn of food and dirnk in religious contexts

Various religions and spiritual practices have incorporated food and drink into their rituals throughout time. Certain dishes and beverages carry symbolic weight, whether adherents are partaking in communion or celebrating Passover Seder. Red wine and tea figure during certain rites and are noted in religious literature. Though coffee may not play an active role in religious services, followers of mainstream religions hold a range of attitudes toward the brew. We’ve investigated how coffee is integrated, if at all, among the faithful of different beliefs.

Christianity
Although you may not see a pot of coffee brewing during a Sunday sermon, it’s often a staple for Christian congregations to hold coffee hour after services. Coffee has been an acceptable vice for Christians since Pope Clement VIII famously proclaimed, “Why, this Satan’s drink is so delicious that it would be a pity to let the infidels have exclusive use of it.”

In the early 1600s, Pope Clement VIII allegedly blessed the beans to entice Christians to choose coffee over alcohol. Today, the beverage remains a staple in gatherings of most denominations and offshoots of Christianity, except for The Church of Latter-day Saints, also known as the Mormon church. Caffeinated beverages are banned in the Mormon faith due to their “mind altering” effects and “addictive” qualities.
